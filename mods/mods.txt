Tandy Assembly 2024 - BBS Display

Modifications to stock configuration

1) Running from LDOS on FreHD - no floppies needed
    BBS originally ran on 2 floppy system, under TRSDOS or LDOS
    Software Modifications required:
        a) Install LDOS system to floppy drive (via emulator)
        b) Copy all BBS-related files to bootable hard disk drive (FreHD)
        c) Modify HOST/BAS -> RHOST/BAS, line 100 - change SD$ and DD$ to new drive (ex. ":3")
        d) Recreate RUPLOAD/ASM from UPLOAD/CMD and magazine article
        e) Re-assemble RUPLOAD/ASM to RUPLOAD/CMD, moving the address away from KI and RSH device locations in high memory
        f) Modify LINKUP/JCL to RLINKUP/JCL, with following changes:
            reset KI first, before setting it again
            change MEMORY HIGH address to protect new RUPLOAD/CMD location
            load RUPLOAD/CMD instead of UPLOAD/CMD
            launch BASIC instead of LBASIC (newer version?)

2) Auto-Answer Hardware for Telephone Interface II:
    '80 Micro circuit: 
    Ring detect connects line to phone
    CASRELAY controls ability of circuit to pickup phone, or hangs up phone
    RHOST/BAS needs changes to do this

3) SYSOP Audible pager:
    CASOUT connected to amplifier
    RHOST/BAS and maybe RUPLOAD/CMD needs changes to support this

4) Switch to turn of monitor - installed back in the day
   No software changes needed for this
